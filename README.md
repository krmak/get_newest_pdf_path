# get_newest_pdf_path

For this personal Python coding project, I prepared a script that accesses the local file path, creates lists of locally stored PDF file paths and their respective modified dates, concatenates each file path and its corresponding date into a tuple, 
packages those tuples into a list, sorts that tuple list by descending modified date, and selects the path for the most recently modified PDF file.
